# ClimateGrow-Predictive Agriculture Insights for Climate Affected Crop Yields

ClimateGrow is an online application powered by artificial intelligence, which tells how climate change will continue to affect vegetable and fruit growing. Sample datasets of historical crop yields, temperature variability, and rainfall patterns were used in the project to test the feasibility of AI-powered predictions. The first prototype produced will focus on visualizations regarding crops whose yield failed in the previous years and a sketch of future yield trends according to several possible climatic scenarios. The scope goes to empirical data collection in Nepal with the intent to advance the model at hand. ClimateGrow aspires to provide enough contextual support to farmers and policy-makers alike, proactively offering evidence-based strategies with which it will be possible to attenuate agricultural risks because of climate change.
